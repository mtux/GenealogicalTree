A **Genealogical Tree** to keep and show information about a family tree.

Build instruction: *(To build you would need CMake, and GCC 5.x in addition to GNU Make.)*
```
  $ cd GenealogicalTree
  $ mkdir build && cd build
  $ cmake ..
  $ make
```

To use it, just run the executable and follow the instructions. You can load and use the "*sample_tree.txt*" file which comes with the source code or create a new one via the application itself.
